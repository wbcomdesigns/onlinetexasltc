== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need server access to use this plugin? =

While server access is recommended for optimal performance, you can use a reverse proxy server or services like Cloudflare Workers to handle domain mapping without direct server access.

= How does SSL certificate management work? =

The plugin supports multiple SSL providers:
* **Cloudflare**: Automatic SSL with Cloudflare integration
* **Let's Encrypt**: Automated certificate provisioning
* **Manual**: Upload your own certificates

= Can vendors use subdomains? =

Yes! Vendors can map both root domains (example.com) and subdomains (shop.example.com) to their stores.

= Is there a limit on domains per vendor? =

Yes, you can configure domain limits per vendor in the plugin settings. Default is 1 domain per vendor.

= How secure is the DNS verification? =

The plugin uses TXT record verification, which is the industry standard for domain ownership verification. Each domain gets a unique verification token.

= Can I customize the vendor dashboard interface? =

Yes! The plugin provides hooks, filters, and template overrides for complete customization.

= Does this work with WordPress Multisite? =

The plugin is designed for single-site installations. Multisite compatibility is planned for future versions.

= How do I handle SSL certificate renewals? =

The plugin includes automated SSL renewal checks via WordPress cron jobs and will notify vendors of expiring certificates.
